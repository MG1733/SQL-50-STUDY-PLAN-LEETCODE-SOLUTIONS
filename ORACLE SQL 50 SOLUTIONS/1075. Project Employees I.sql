-- Letters which are capitalized here indicates the inbuilt keywords in SQL
/* IN Oracle, itâ€™s safest to keep inline comments on their own line 
instead of sticking them in the middle of a SQL expression*/
-- Here Only Special functions and keywords used mainly in Oracle are commented in queries.
-- ALIAS are kept in "double quotes" which makes it case sensitive(works in Oracle SQL)
